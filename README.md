# fisher_deriv.py runs CLASS many times for each parameter and fits a polynomial at each l to compute a polynomial derivative to be fed into a fisher matrix. need to finish polynomial derivative and add error to fisher matrix.

# emery.py is my full fisher code from the axionCAMB project (with some extraneous things commented out) -- the best fit step sizes are from a separate derivative code
